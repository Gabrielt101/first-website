			<h1> Personal summary</h1>
			<p> A student looking for an opportunity to start a part time job as I have just started college. I’d like to get the experience of working early so I can adapt to it in the future. This could also be an opportunity to start learning my future as well by knowing how money works and how to save and what not. I think my main focus for this journey is to find a job where I use my hands. The reason being is because I know it's hard work and I’m not the type of person to go for everything that's easy.
